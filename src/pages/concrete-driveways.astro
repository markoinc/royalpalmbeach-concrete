    question: "How much does a concrete driveway cost in Palm Beach County?",
    answer: `Concrete driveway costs in Royal Palm Beach and surrounding areas typically range from $8-$18 per square foot. A standard 400-600 sq ft driveway costs $4,000-$10,000 for basic installation. Stamped or decorative concrete adds $3-6 per square foot. Factors affecting price include site preparation, removal of existing driveway, thickness, reinforcement, and finish type. Call ${siteConfig.phone} for a free, accurate estimate for your specific project.`
  },
  {
    question: "How thick should a residential concrete driveway be?",
    answer: "For residential driveways in Palm Beach County, we recommend a minimum thickness of 4 inches using 4,000 PSI concrete. If you have heavier vehicles like RVs, trucks, or boats on trailers, we recommend 5-6 inches with additional steel reinforcement. The subbase is equally important — we use a compacted 4-6 inch gravel base to ensure proper drainage and prevent settling in Florida's sandy soils."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a concrete driveway installation take?",
    answer: "Most residential driveway projects take 3-5 days total: 1-2 days for site preparation and forming, 1 day for pouring, and 1-2 days for finishing and cleanup. You can walk on the driveway after 24-48 hours, but should wait 7 days before driving vehicles on it to allow proper curing."
  },
  {
    question: "What causes concrete driveways to crack?",
    answer: "Common causes include improper subbase preparation, inadequate control joints, too-thin concrete, rapid drying in hot weather, heavy vehicle loads, and tree root intrusion. We prevent cracking by using proper mix designs, adequate thickness, control joints every 10-12 feet, fiber mesh or rebar reinforcement, and careful curing techniques suited to Florida's climate."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you replace just part of my driveway?",
    answer: "Yes, we can perform partial driveway replacements for sections that are severely damaged. However, matching the color and texture of existing concrete can be challenging. We'll assess your driveway and recommend whether partial replacement or full replacement makes more sense for your situation and budget."

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Homeowners throughout {siteConfig.county} choose concrete for their driveways because it's perfectly suited to South Florida's climate and conditions:

          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-8">
            <li><strong>Heat Resistance:</strong> Unlike asphalt, which softens in extreme heat, concrete maintains its strength and shape even during Florida's hottest summer days.</li>
            <li><strong>Flood Resistance:</strong> Properly installed concrete withstands the occasional flooding from tropical storms without damage or deterioration.</li>
            <li><strong>UV Stability:</strong> Quality concrete with proper sealers won't fade or deteriorate from constant sun exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> A well-built concrete driveway lasts 25-30+ years compared to 15-20 years for asphalt.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower Maintenance:</strong> No annual sealing required (unlike asphalt). Just occasional cleaning and resealing every 3-5 years.</li>
            <li><strong>No Staining:</strong> Sealed concrete resists oil and fluid stains from vehicles.</li>
